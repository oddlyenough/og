# Curator's Note
Centaurus is a bright constellation in the southern sky consisting of eleven stars. These stars have been kindling our curiosity and imagination as well as 
guiding us with their light across space and time.

This Centaurus is an omnium gatherium. 
A collection of thoughts and ideas from eleven "stars" that serve the same
purpose - kindling curiosity and imagination, guiding lives across space
and time. 

This need not be organized as a book. 
The Internet has all of these material and more. Sharing links to these
resources would have been the easiest and most efficient forms of distribution.
But I wanted to have these ideas handy. Not have to worry about battery levels
or signal strengths. Or have to keep up with the ephemeral nature of links
on the ever changing Web.Prefacing them with a last accessed date as an ugly crutch. 
Offering apologies when others cannot find them. Fretting when I cannot.

I wanted to simply look up and find the guiding light amongst these pages. 

Just like the constellation.

How do these words help me ?
From setting the tone for a day to providing counsel at the end of it. 
From offering a broader perspective to spelling out specific ways to deal with stuff. The words on these pages nudge, inspire, motivate, provoke,
align, focus, ground and guide me.

Hope they do the same and more to you, should you choose to look up.
